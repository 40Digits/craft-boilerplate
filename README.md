# Craft Boilerplate Setup / Installation

1. Import the boilerplate to our [bitbucket team.](https://bitbucket.org/repo/import)
  * Use this as the url: `https://github.com/40Digits/craft-boilerplate.git` to import
2. Clone the newly imported repo
3. `cd` into the root level of the project
4. Application setup instructions are in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
  * Keep [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) in the repo so that future devs know how to begin with this project
  * Update [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) with the specific tools you use for a project. For instance, if you need to use composer, make sure to add a setup step
5. After you're finished, replace this README with the "New Repo README" below
6. Push up your changes and start developing!

### Build Tools
Since the deprecation of Eta, we have since moved to using npm scripts as our build tools and task runner. (For more information on using npm as a build tool feel free to check this [How to use npm as a build tool.](https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/) ) If you're interested in which npm packages we currently use and care to use some of our recipes feel free to check out our [40D-tools-list repo](https://github.com/40Digits/40d-tools-list).
