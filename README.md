# Boilerplate Setup / Installation

1. Setup instructions are in SETUP.md.
2. Keep these instructions in the repo so future devs know how to set this project up.
3. Update those instructions with specific tools you use for a project. For instance, if you need to use composer make sure to add a setup step.
4. After you're finished setting up the site make sure to edit this repo with our standard readme for projects.
